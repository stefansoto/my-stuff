#+TITLE: Critical Thinking
12/09/2014
* Section 1: Barriers to CT
These factors can cause us to overlook relevant evidence, or to prevent us from assessing the evidence for beliefs objectively
** Information
Information is always relevant to the ability to form beliefs
sometimes people lack the background info required to form beliefs or a certain topic or to correct mistakes
Sometimes people don't know that tehy lack vital information, unknown unknowns
** Refusal to change beliefs
Reliable belief formation sometimes requires un to give up certain beliefs as new information is discovered
This can be hard as people are often unwilling or unable to change their beliefs as they see them as part of their self.
** Egocentric thinking
Believing something because it is in your interest
wishful thinking
saving face
self deception
** Too influenced by authority
some people allow themselves to be too influenced by authority figures 
when you follow someone else blindly you don't have your own opinions and beliefs you are mearly a puppet
ignoring the options
milgram experiment
** Bias, Prejudice, Racism
** fear of critism, narrow minded, lazy, cautious
some personality traits that can get in the way of critical thinking
** World view (background)
can be a lens through which you view the world and distort what you see
** subjective relativism
"truth is relative" 
"what's true for you isn't true for me"
Truths are objective and boolean. 
1) not common sense
2) entails that our beliefs can never be wrong, which is BS
3) relativism is self-defective, that is it shits on it's self. If somethings are relative then everything should be relative. Including the theory its self.

* Section 2: The Basics. Analyzing and Reconstructing Arguments
** Definition of Argument
   Doesn't mean quarrel, fight, disagreement
   Is a set of two or more statements or claims, one of which, the Conclusion, is intended to follow from, or be supported by, the others, which are the premises
   Someone makes a claim and tries to support it with other claims
   
** Recognizing Arguments
*** Inference
   An inference is a claim to that one thing makes something else true
   an inference is a requirement of an argument
   
   reasoning is inference
   
*** Statements and claims are NOT arguments
   Nearly asserting claims is not an arguement because there is no inference.
   Watch for this with trick questions.
   
*** Argument vs statement
   statement: true/false, justified/unjustified, plausible/not pluasible
   arguement strong/weak, good/bad but are still arguments
   
*** Arguments reconstruction
   Sometimes people don't know what argument they are making. Figuring it out is arguement reconstruction.
   1) determine if there even is an argument
   2) distinguishing argument from non-argument
   3) indentify the premises and conclusion of the argument
   4) refomulating the premises and conclusion
   5) Doing a structure diagram for the argument
*** Identifying premise and conclusion
   A single sentence may contain more than one premise or just one or the conclusion
   conclusion may be stated anywhere in the discourse. Usually beginning or end.
   Find Conclusion first
   
*** logical indicators
    Therefore or because are good indicators of a conclusion and premise.
    Indicates logical relationships
    premise indicators ie. because, as, since, for, provided that, given that
    conclusion indicators ie. Therefore, thus, hence, consequently, so
    Not always true. Might be just background info.
    If it could be "because" it's a premise indicator, if it could be "therefore" it's conclusion indicator

*** The principle of Charity
    If a passage has multiple interpretations, then use whichever argument is more logical or reasonable
    give them the benefit of the doubt
    Not trying to improve the argument

*** Distinguishing argument from non-argument
When people give speeches/blogs/editorial etc not everything they say is an argument
most not arguments are:
- background information
- disclaimers
- commentary
- counter arguments
- miscellaneous 
- repetition

*** Unstated Premises and Conclusions
A problem that arises in reconstructing arguments is premises and conclusions are often left unstated. These are called enthymemes.

*** Things that look like arguments:

**** Reports
Merely reports. Not inferring anything.
**** Unsupported claims
There is no support to back up claims. Just a conclusion.
**** conditionals

**** compound statements
two or more statements. Complicated enough to make them look like arguments.
**** explanations
don't infer anything

** Structure Diagrams
*** Structure Diagrams
all arguments have logical structure. There is a particular way in which the arguments combine with each other to support the conclusion
we can represent the logical structure in a diagram called structure diagram
*** Steps in constructing SD
- number all statements or claims made in the passage
- identify logical indicators
- identify premises and conclusion
- identify and cross out any parts of the passage that are not part of the argument
*** Conventions for diagrams
premises are above and conclusions below
direction of inference is always downwards thus
**** ex
1

|
V

2 
*** Convention Con't
when lines descending from premises "join up" before reaching the claim below this means the premises must be taken together to have good reason to accept the conclusion. i.e. must be taken in context
when lines lead seperately from each premise by itself means each premise is valid enough to accept the conclusion.
**** ex
 1   2                            1   2
 |   |                            _____
 V   V                              V
   3                                3

both 1 and 2 are valid       Points must be taken
enough points on their       Together
own




** Argument Validity
