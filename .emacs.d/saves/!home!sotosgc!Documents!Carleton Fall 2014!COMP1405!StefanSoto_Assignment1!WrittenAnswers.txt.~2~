Question 1.
Decomposition:
Problems are everywhere in life and using decompostion to break them down makes solving big scary problems into solving lots of little scary (but manageable!) problems. This summer I helped build my aunts deck and rather than just "building a deck" and just running straight at the problem we started with the foundation, then the frame, then finally the boards on top. Thanks to decomposing the problem it was a lot more manageable.

Pattern Recognition:
By recognizing patterns and things that repeat themselves faster you can catch onto what you're doing wrong faster and often take short cuts and simplify things. For example you're writing a program to draw something on the screen like what we have been doing in class lately and you realize that you have several circles being drawn with the same centre you can use pattern recognition to spot that these circles have something in common and could be replaced with a single variable.

Pattern Generalization and Abstraction:
I like doing logic puzzles and by using pattern generalization and abstraction is very useful for filtering out useless information and allowing you to focus only on what's really important.

Algorithm Design:
Developing a step-by-step process for doing almost anything allows you to break problems down not unlike using decomposition. If you are for example cooking a meal, something I've been attempting lately, you need to follow directions if you want the meal to taste good and not be horribly burnt. Cooking with a recipe is kinda like a computer following a written algorithm because you're doing exactly what you're told to the letter.

Question 2.
1. During "take Bus route 4 (OC Transpo) direction Hurdman" it is not specified that you must take this route in a bus. Only that the route is a bus route. One might take it on a bike or in a car.
2. During "Walk to VIA Rail." the route that you take to get to VIA Rail is not specified.
3. "Wait 4 minute(s)." By not specifying where to wait the person might end up having to scram to catch their bus and end up missing it.
